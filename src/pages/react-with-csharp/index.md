My name is Brian Harney and I'll be walking your through hard problems that may help you.

I've been building several applications over the last two years using React with .Net Core
and I would like to share with you what I've learned. Its been great fun, and also wild frustration
by working on the bleeding edge. Unfortunately most of the technology surounding React is built for node.
However I LOVE C#. So I decieded to dive deep and see what I could build using the infrastructure
provided by Microsoft's .NET Core.
