My name is Brian Harney and I love building incredible software. Our increasingly connected world demands services that are resiliant, fast, and always available. We've has been raising our expectations about web applications, and rethinking how we share code and ideas. But sometimes it can be difficult to understand all of the new technology because the web has been changing at a mile a minute. I want to show you some of the things I've learned in my own experiences building applications. I hope that these writings may help you in your search for an answers/solutions to your own problems.

#React with C#
I've been building applications over the years using React. And recently I found a combination of 
React with .Net Core that started from a SpaTemplate called JavaScriptServices. I've started to 
build on this platform. And I would like to share with you what I've learned. Unfortunately most 
of the technology surounding React is built for node. However I really am a fan boy of C#. So I decieded to dive deep 
and see what I could build using the infrastructure provided by Microsoft's .NET Core. Its been great fun, 
and also wildy frustrating by working in a space that few developer explore. But you can see a link to
the project I have been building called [JSStarter](http://jsstarter.azurewebsites.net). [Github](https://github.com/bharney/StarterPack).
