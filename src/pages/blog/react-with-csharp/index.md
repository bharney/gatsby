I've been building applications over the years using React. And recently I found a combination of 
React with .Net Core that started from a SpaTemplate called JavaScriptServices. I've started to 
build on this platform. And I would like to share with you what I've learned. Unfortunately most 
of the technology surounding React is built for node. However I really am a fan boy of C#. So I decieded to dive deep 
and see what I could build using the infrastructure provided by Microsoft's .NET Core. Its been great fun, 
and also wildy frustrating by working in a space that few developer explore. But you can see a link to
the project I have been building called [JSStarter](http://jsstarter.azurewebsites.net). Clone or fork the repo on [Github](https://github.com/bharney/StarterPack).
